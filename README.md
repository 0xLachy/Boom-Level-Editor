# Boom Level Editor
This project is a way for making custom levels for the app "Boom!" by Happy Sprites which is an ios game [Boom Fandom Wiki](https://boomhappysprites.fandom.com/wiki/BOOM!_Wiki)
>**You need the app to play and test the level** 

For help or to show us your level join our discord! ðŸ˜„

## Installation Guide
1. [Have the Boom app installed on your ios device](https://boom.markstam.eu/install)
2. Download Unity Hub from [https://store.unity.com/download](https://store.unity.com/download)

3. Clone this repository or download as a zip (then unzip) and put it in a folder where you want to keep your Unity projects e.g \<yourname>\Unity\Projects

4. In Unity Hub on the projects tab, click on *add* then go to wherever you saved this repo and double-click on the repo folder, then press enter.
5. Once it is added, it may tell you that you are missing the unity version required, choose any version that is above 2020, if you don't have any, unity hub will help you download one, or go to the installs tab on the left, then click on *add* and then choose a 2020 version, you don't *need* any extra modules, but having visual studio may come in handy.
6. Now that you have all the requirements ready, double-click on the project in the projects window in unity hub and you should be good to go! ðŸ˜€

## How To Use
if you haven't used unity before I recommend watching a quick tutorial on how the unity layout works, you won't need to do any coding with the C# scripts though.

Every scene we make is a different level, there are quite a few on the github already so they can be pretty good examples.
### Creating A New Level
<!-- I'm not sure if the right click is right-->
To get started and to make your own level, in the scenes folder (in the bottom window) right click, then choose "create new scene"
it will create a new scene for you, but before you click make sure to name it, so type in a new name and press enter.
![Create Scene](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Create%20scene.png)
### Adding the sprites to the level
Down the bottom, if you go to the resources/textures folder, there is the sprites for the game, they are in a few seperate groups, to use a specific sprite, expand the group (press the small triangle on the right of the group image) It will look something like this:
![Expand Sprite Example](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Expand%20Sprite%20Group.png)

To add the sprite, just drag it into the scene/level.

### Prefabs
>Knowing what A [Unity Prefab](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Prefabs.html) is will help you understand this

Some sprites need a script added to them so they can be added to boom properly, or you can combine multiple into a shape you like so then you can create the shape quickly also some that you use heaps like the cage and wheel are added there to get them quicker.
Drag them in just like you would the other sprites.
![Prefabs](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Prefabs.png)

### Ground
> Adding ground to the level is different to adding other sprites. 

The SpriteShapeController can be a bit buggy and if your points are too close together it will cause the export script to infinitely pause the Unity Editor. The only way to stop Unity is by using task manager (ctrl+shift+escape, right click on unity and then end task)

To prevent losing your progress, save before you export the level (if you are using the SpriteShapeController). If it exports fine, which it usually does, you don't have to save untill the next time you edit the spline again

After dragging in the ground to the scene **do not use the rect tool!** We use the spline points to export into the game (unity scale won't work in game)
![Edit Spline Example](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/EditSpline.png)

Click on a point to move it, or click on the line between two points to create a new point! If you want to delete a point, click on the point, then press delete on your keyboard. Also you can select multiple at once by dragging your mouse across the wanted points. (or you can ctrl+click to do multiple points at once)

### Physics Modifier
We have created a script that can create custom physics for objects, in order to use it, in the inspector pannel of the object you want to modify click on "Add Component" then search for the Boom Physics Modifier
![add component](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Add%20Component1.png)
![search componnent](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Search%20Component.png)

After you Add it, the inspector will have another vertical tab containing the physics properties, here is one that I have for a flying spike!

![Physic Properties](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Physics%20Properties.png)

if you don't know what something does, hover your mouse over the name and Unity will give a tooltip explaining it.

### Tags 
In the inspecter right under the name, where it says "Tag Untagged" if you click that untagged you will see there are a few tags made. If you give a sprite a tag, it will overwrite the in game tag, to be a tag of another sprite, so if you give a coin a "bomb" tag, it will act like a bomb when hit in game. (There are a few tags that unity has their by default, just ignore them) 
![Unity Tag Example](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Unity%20Tag%20Example.png)

### Quicksand and Big Wheel
Quicksand and the Big Wheel powerup were in the games files but unreleased, because of that they are a bit buggy and big wheel doesn't actually have a sprite image. To use them just drag in the prefab like you would the other stuff.

### Exporting the level
Currently you can't play the level in the unity editor just yet. To play and test the level out, you need to play it in the custom ipa.

First thing you need to do is export the level, up in the top, go to boom >> export PLHS. Or you can press ctrl+g

![Export Level](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Export%20Level.png)

The level will be stored as plhs (which is just a plist file and the format boom uses to understand the level) in the *Levels* folder, to find the level just go to wherever you saved the project and you should see *Levels* next to the *Assets* folder.

### Import Level
If you want to edit and customise a level already in the game, go to Boom >> Import PLHS. (It is just under Export PLHS). It will open up a file pannel and ask you to choose a .plhs file, choose the level that you want and then it will add everything from that level into the unity editor. If the level contains ground, click on the ground then in the inspector window where it says profile, click on that circle icon, and choose a profile with the same name as the ground or what the debug.Log says. Then in the sprite renderer tab just above it, click on the color box and make that white. The ground should now look normal.

## Testing/Playing the level
<!-- add link to take you to the Add to Ipa script-->
There are a few methods for testing the level, you can set up a local server on your computer or you can use discord. You can go the Add to Ipa route, but that involves reinstalling the ipa, which isn't much of a hastle if your jailbroken, but takes the longest to do.

### Steps for running a local server
1. Make sure you have Python3 installed and on the path, (Python will automatically be added to the path usually)
2. Open up Powershell or Bash then type `cd '/Path-To-Levels'` where the path is the location of your levels directory, you can find it in file explorer by clicking up the top like this: ![Path From File Explorer](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/File%20Explorer.png) If your path was the one in the image, the command would be `cd 'C:\Users\Lachl\Github\Boom-Level-Editor\Levels'`
3. Find out what IP adress you have, in powershell run the command `ipconfig` or in bash run `ip addr show` you want the ipv4 adress, if there are multiple, any of them should work. I use the wireless one usually.
4. run `python -m http.server` (if that doesn't work, try py, or python3 -m http.server). 
5. Now that the server has started, on your device that has boom installed and go on a web browser, go to `http://<IpAddress>:<port>` (e.g `http://192.168.1.124:8000/`) by default the port is 8000, if the port is already being used by something, run `python -m http.server <freePort>`.
6. It should show a file listing of all the levels in the level folder, tap and hold on the level you want to play, then copy link address, then go to boom and click on "Level URL" in custom settings, then paste the link in the text box that shows up ![Game Settings](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Game%20Settings.png)
7. Go to any level that you don't care about the ghost and have fun! The good thing about having the local server, is that every time you export the level, it will update the file on the local server automatically, all you need to do to update the level in boom is exit the level and go back in.

Once understand how to do it, it is definitely the easiest way to test your level, but it can be even faster to set up. 
>[Good tutorial on powershell aliases, functions and profile](https://youtu.be/0Rl_V079HEw)

1. In Powershell, to make sure you can use the function every time you open a new powershell window, you need a profile, to check if you have a profile already run `Test-Path $Profile` if it returns false then run `New-Item -Path $Profile -ItemType File -Force` to create one. 
2. Open your profile with a text editor `notepad $Profile`
3. Paste this code into your profile, replace \<Path-To-Levels-Folder> with the path from explorer (leave the apostrophes) and save.
>If you are using bash, then `vim` (or `nano` if you can't use `vim`, but do learn it) into **~/.bash_aliasas** and it is almost the same, but swap `Set-Location` with `cd` and `Select-String` with `grep`. 
```Powershell
function boomserv()
{
    Set-Location '<Path-To-Levels-Folder>'
    ipconfig | Select-String "IPv4"
    python -m http.server
}
``` 
Now close powershell and reopen it, if you run `boomserv` it should work now. You still need to do steps 5-7.

### Discord Method
The discord method is okay if you don't plan on updating your level very often and the good thing about it is that discord will host the file for you and will only go away if you delete the file, but it also means that everytime you make a change to the level and export it in the level editor you need to redo steps 2+

1. Create a new server for yourself in discord
2. In one of the text channels you can either drag in the level from file explorer, or in the message thing down the bottom click the plus icon and find the level.
3. Right Click on the message and click "copy link" (make sure you don't click copy message link). ![Discord Copy Link](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/Discord%20Download.png)
4. The link is usually super long so using a link shortener is handy, a good website is [bombch.us](http://bombch.us)
5. In the "Level URL" box in the settings part inside the boom app, put the new shortened link. 
6. Choose any level that you don't care about the ghost.

## Add to Ipa
<!--Improve this, I am not happy with it-->
This is usually what you do when you are finished with the level and you think that it is ready to be added to game. If you want to add the game to the shared Ipa so that everybody can play your knew level then ask us in the discord and we will add you to the ipa github.

Putting your level in the ipa means you don't need to use a link to load the level and you can have it with its own ghost and targets and stuff. The easiest way to get it in game is with the "Add to Ipa" which is at Boom >> Add to Ipa, right under Import PLHS. Once you click it this window will show up:
![TargetEditorWindow](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/TargetEditorWindow.png)

There are 3 things you have to do to export, you need the levels.plist file from inside boom.app (This is what displays the level in game). You need the new level that you are going to add to the Ipa and then you need to set the in-game name.

To add the levels.plist file, click on the name which is a button, that will open up a file explorer, double click on the file, do the same for the new level file. It will save the path to that file and display it in the text box to the right. You can also paste in the path there instead.

For the in-game name, you don't need to add Custom_ to the front, this is what will display in the level list as you scroll in game. You can have spaces in the name. Just type it in their. 

To the right of the in-game name is the background, click that and choose from the options that pop up.

To have a super star challenge in your level, when the button is ticked, it will add an extra target to the list.

Under the have a super star challenge is the targets, to change the type of target click on the popup button on the left and change it, then to change the value for the target just type in the text box. If you want to have a multi-target, click on the plus icon, If you change your mind just hit the minus icon to remove it. Bellow the targets is a boom character, if all the targets are different he will be fully complete, if they are all the same it will just be the character, if 2 are the same then it will be him just on the seat.

Once your ready click on Add to Plist and it will do it's magic, If the level already exists you can choose to overwrite the targets to be your new ones, and/or overwrite the old level (plhs file).

The sprites just below the add to plist are just there to help visualise the targets you chose.

### Settings
![BoomSettings](Assets/Resources/Github%20Guide%20Images/BoomSettings%20Window.png) 

The default settings should work just fine, but if you want to add the level to a certain spot you will need to turn on insert new level before finder string (which may or may not be enabled by default). Then change the string to the name of the level before it. If you don't have it enabled it will just add the level to the end of extreme levels.
